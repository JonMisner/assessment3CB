3rd Assessment for CB. Build a nav bar.

I created a simple navbar using CSS and HTML. I then added a dropdown menu to the "inventory" item. After that I added some simple hover and click (using javascript) functionalitly to make it work. And Then added a media query to re-do the CSS for a smaller (mobile) screen.
